# E-Flash

E-Flash is an educational Rails app designed to help learners of English as a second language expand their vocabulary. Users are able to create customized vocabulary word banks and then 'flash card' drill those words to practice learning parts of speech and definitions. An integrated external API helps users retrieve definitions and parts of speech for words. AJAX implementation helps to make for a seamless, smoother user experience as words are defined, added to the word bank and then 'drilled'.
